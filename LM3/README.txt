This plugin is a quick fork of ZF3 z-ray plugin. Some find/replace was done in order to get it to work with with Laminas.

The Laminas Framework 3 plugin provides in-depth visibility into your application, with live and detailed information on all the different framework elements working under-the-hood. Get general information about the application's configuration, together with valuable profiling data on events, modules, and view helpers.
The Laminas Framework 3 plugin also defines the routing logic for Zend Framework 1 requests - for better events aggregation in Zend Server, and improved results for URLs in URL Insight.
