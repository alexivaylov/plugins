# Laminas Z-ray plugin

This plugin was forked from the original Zend Server 2019 "Zend framework 3" plugin.

I did a quick find/replace to make it work with Laminas.

# Install
1. Download the LM3.zip file
2. Go into Zend Server UI
3. Click "Plugins"
4. Click "Manage Plugins"
5. Click "Deploy plugin" button
6. Click the "Browse" button and select the LM3.zip file you just downloaded
7. Follow the wizard

Tested on Zend Server 2019.0.3 on Ubuntu 18.04.

PRs are welcome.

Hopefully Zend will release an official plugin soon..
